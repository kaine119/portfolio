I'm an aspiring computer and electrical engineer based in Singapore.   
I'm studying Computer Engineering under the Engineering Product Development (EPD) programme at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). 

My current interests are in
* electronics, particularly microcontrollers and computing-adjacent electronics
* PCB design for consumer products
* 3D printing
* UAVs, including FPV drones

...and I've been building my expertise in these areas through the [projects I've done]({{ site.base_url }}/portfolio).

Some of the skills I've picked up so far include
* Firmware development &mdash; Arduino, ESP32 platforms (a little bit of STM32), using C
* PCB design – KiCad, STM32 integration in real-life applications
* Microcontroller solution architecture with STM32, Arduino/AVR, ESP32
* Mechanical design – Autodesk Fusion360 / Inventor, Solidworks
* Soldering, electronics testing, fabrication and assembly

I also have extensive experience in software development from my earlier days, including:
* Scripting with Python, Ruby, Bash in Linux environments
* Native application development &mdash; Have worked with Android (Java/Kotlin), Windows WPF .NET (C#)
* Full-stack web application development &mdash; Experience in HTML/CSS/JS, Vue.JS, AngularJS 1.x, Flask,
ExpressJS, Heroku, Jekyll
